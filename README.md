# ROS-Nodelet-Tutorial
A step by step tutorial of nodelets based on the ROS example and done with containers

There seems to be very few information on ROS nodelets. The one tutorial that you can find is in the ROS official page.
However to be frank, I find it complicated and hard to understand.

I have also build my own docker containers for ROS (and ROS2 too ;) ) so in this tutorial I will use all of those to build
a simple tutorial of how to do a ROS nodelet.
